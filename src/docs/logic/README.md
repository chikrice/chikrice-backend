# Logic Documentation

This folder contains documentation for the business logic and algorithms used throughout the ChikRice backend application.

## Purpose

The logic documentation serves as a reference for understanding:

- Complex business rules and algorithms
- Data processing workflows
- Decision-making processes
- System architecture patterns

## Current Contents

- **roadmap/**: Documentation for roadmap-related logic and workflows
  - `flow-chart.md`: Detailed flow charts for roadmap processes
  - `flow-diagram.md`: Visual diagrams of roadmap logic

## Future Additions

This folder will be gradually populated with documentation for various logical components as they are developed and refined. Each subfolder will contain relevant documentation for specific features or modules.

## Contributing

When adding new logic documentation:

1. Create appropriate subfolders for feature-specific logic
2. Include both high-level overviews and detailed implementation notes
3. Use clear, descriptive file names
4. Update this README when adding new sections
